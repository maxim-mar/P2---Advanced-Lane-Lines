    "## Sobel Operator\n",
    "The Sobel operator is at the heart of the Canny edge detection algorithm you used in the Introductory Lesson. Applying the Sobel operator to an image is a way of taking the derivative of the image in the xxx or yyy direction. The operators for SobelxSobel_xSobelx​ and SobelySobel_ySobely​, respectively, look like this:\n",
    "![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2016/December/584cbe5e_soble-operator/soble-operator.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "These are examples of Sobel operators with a kernel size of 3 (implying a 3 x 3 operator in each case). This is the minimum size, but the kernel size can be any odd number. A larger kernel implies taking the gradient over a larger region of the image, or, in other words, a smoother gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how these operators take the derivative, you can think of overlaying either one on a 3 x 3 region of an image. If the image is flat across that region (i.e., there is little change in values across the given region), then the result (summing the element-wise product of the operator and corresponding image pixels) will be zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$gradient=∑(region∗S_x​)$$\n",

    "For example, given:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$region = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 2 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 2 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 2 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$$, $$S_x = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ -2 & 0 & 2 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The element-wise product would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & 0 & 2 \\\\ -4 & 0 & 4 \\\\ -2 & 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In which case, the sum of this matrix is 000, implying a flat gradient (in the x-direction in this calculation, although the y-direction is also zero in this example).\n",
    "\n",
    "If, instead, for example, you apply the SxS_xSx​ operator to a region of the image where values are rising from left to right, then the result will be positive, implying a positive derivative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$region = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}$$ , $$S_x = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ -2 & 0 & 2 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 3 \\\\ -2 & 0 & 6 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This time, the sum of this matrix is 888, meaning a gradient exists in the x-direction. Note that in this example image region, if you applied the SyS_ySy​ operator, the result would be a gradient of 000 in the y-direction, as the values are not varying from top to bottom.\n",

For example, a dark red will have a similar hue but much lower value for lightness than a light red. Saturation also plays a part in this; saturation is a measurement of colorfulness. So, as colors get lighter and closer to white, they have a lower saturation value, whereas colors that are the most intense, like a bright primary color (imagine a bright red, blue, or yellow), have a high saturation value. You can get a better idea of these values by looking at the 3D color spaces pictured below.\n",
